<h1>About ATS Resume Checker</h1>

<p>
ATS Resume Checker is a free online tool designed to help job seekers understand
how well their resume matches a specific job description.
</p>

<p>
Many companies use Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) to automatically screen resumes
before they reach a human recruiter. Our tool helps you measure ATS compatibility
by analyzing keyword alignment, skills relevance, role matching, experience signals,
and formatting factors.
</p>

<p>
This tool is built for students, freshers, and professionals who want to improve
their chances of getting shortlisted for interviews.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Important:</strong> Your resume is processed entirely in your browser.
We do not store, collect, or share resumes or job descriptions.
